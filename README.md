# Tech Quiz App

## 📚 Overview

The **Tech Quiz App** is a full-stack application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that allows users to test their tech knowledge with a randomized 10-question quiz. The app has been enhanced with comprehensive **Cypress** tests for both **component** and **end-to-end** (E2E) testing to ensure reliability and performance.

This project demonstrates modern development practices with a strong emphasis on automated testing.
